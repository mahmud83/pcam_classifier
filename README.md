## PatchCamelyon Classifier

My task was to:
1. Implement and train a classifier on the PatchCamelyon dataset following the classifier that is part of the overall model proposed in the paper ["Detecting Cancer Metastases on Gigapixel Pathology Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02442). You can find the implementation in [this notebook](pcam_training.ipynb).
2. Implement the image color normalization process described in appendix 3 of the same paper, which you can find in [this notebook](image_color_normalization.ipynb).
